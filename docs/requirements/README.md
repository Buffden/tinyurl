# Requirements

This directory contains the formal requirements specification for TinyURL, split into functional requirements, non-functional requirements, and use cases.

The original consolidated requirements document lives at [`../architecture/00-baseline/poc-requirements-baseline.md`](../architecture/00-baseline/poc-requirements-baseline.md). The files in this directory provide a structured, referenceable breakdown of those requirements.

## Reading Order

1. Start with **functional requirements** to understand system capabilities.
2. Review **non-functional requirements** to understand performance and reliability constraints.
3. Read **use cases** for detailed interaction flows.

For individual use case specifications with full detail, see [`../use-cases/`](../use-cases/).
